# HTML & CSS Projects

Here are my most recent websites using HTML and CSS.

## Projects

- Space Station site
- Movie Theater site

### Space Station
This site offers a glimpse into the future. I styled it using CSS, including a navbar, image containers and a form.

### Movie Theater

For this site I came down to earth and styled it with Bootstrap 4. In addition to Bootstrap components, it also includes a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, and dropdown.
