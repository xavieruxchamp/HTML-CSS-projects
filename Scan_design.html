			<p>Here is a quote from the New York Times opinion about the Bauhaus design movement</p>
			<blockquote cite="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/opinion/what-was-the-bauhaus.html"> Hitlerian antagonists — the Nazis were intent on making Germany great again after the nation’s humiliating and economically crippling defeat in the First World War, the very event that had given rise, within a few months, to the Weimar Republic and a new art school, also in Weimar, where all hierarchies between art and design were to be abolished. Destroying both the republic and the school were among the Nazis’ first tasks.
